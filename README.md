# Geo-Politik
Geo-Politik is a political game, putting you into the seat of power of your respective country. In Geo-Politik you make all of the important decisions and you are the driving force of all your countrys decisions. Geo-Politik is designed as a text based adventure game, but it has the user making geo-political decisions to traverese through the adventure. Rather than a playable character, you are a playable country that is navigating through an ever escalating geographical and political crisis. Play in 3 different scenarios each with its own unique country (Taiwan, Poland, Mongolia) and challenges.
