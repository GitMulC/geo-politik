# Geo-Politik
Geo-Politik is a political game, putting you into the seat of power of your respective country. In Geo-Politik you make all of the important decisions and you are the driving force of all your countries decisions. Geo-Politik is designed as a text based adventure game, but it has the user making geo-political decisions to traverese through the adventure. Rather than a playable character, you are a playable country that is navigating through an ever escalating geographical and political climate. 

## User Stories
- As a user I want to play a text based political game where I get to make decisions about my country of choice
- As a user I want to learn about the impact of political decisions on a country. 
- As a user I want to know more about how seemingly small decisions can have long lasting effects on a geo-political climate.

Welcome GitMulC,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
